# TINU
TINU, the macOS installer creation tool
[TINU Is Not Unibeast]
This sofwtare is intended to be used as a GUI to create a bootable mac os installer for mac and hackintosh, it's basically a GUI for the createinstallmedia script that could be found on any mac os isnatllation apps.

Allows you to create easily mac os installers without messing around with command line stuff. 

Here hare some features:
 - Simple to use UI that allows you to easily start the installer creation process
 - It can work with every Mac OS installer app that has the createinstallmedia executable inside it's resources folder (including also beta and newly released installers)
 - You can use any drive with a GUID partition sceme and HFS+ file system 
 - Works on Mac OS recovery, so you can create Mac OS installers from a bootable installer or from the recovery
 - All vanilla, the installers created with this tool are 100% vanilla mac os installers
 - Open source, you will know what this program runs on your computer
 - Creates working installers for Mac and hackintosh
 - Does not requires to change your system language, just open it up!
 
Coming soon features:
 - Installer customization
 - Kernel cache and boot files replacement, a feature that can be handy wile dealing with old Macs or with beta installers when you need to mod the boot files
 
Features that I'd like to add in the future:
 - Install clover and configure clover
 - Install kexts inside the kexts folder of clover
 - Clover drivers customization
 - Use custom dsdt in clover
 - integrated pre-made clover config tamplets database
 - Support for other languages, at least Italian
 
TINU currently needs Yosemite to run and it does requires El Capitan to run on recovery/Mac installer

Source code is in Swift 3
