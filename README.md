# TINU
TINU, the macOS install media creation tool

[TINU Is Not Unibe**t]

This software is intended to be used as a GUI to create a bootable mac os installer for mac and hackintosh, it's basically a GUI for the createinstallmedia executable that could be found on any mac os installation apps.

Allows you to create easily a macOS install media without messing around with command line stuff and without using disk utility. 

# Features:
  - Simple to use UI that allows you to easily start the macOS install media creation process
  - It can work with every Mac OS installer app that has the createinstallmedia executable inside of it's resources folder (including also beta and newly released installers)
  - You can use any drive or partition you want that can be erased and is at least 7 GB of size
  - Works on Mac OS recovery, so you can create a macOS install media from a bootable macOS installer or from the macOs recovery
  - All vanilla, the macOS install medias created with this tool are 100% vanilla, just like you created them using the command line "createinstallmedia" method
  - Open source, you will know what this program does on your computer
  - Does not requires to change your system language, just open it up, or any other special thing first!
  - No need to go in disk utility first, TINU can format your drive for you!
  - Uses recent and more modern APIs and SDKs and Swift 3 language
 
 Coming soon features:
  - Advanced section, to customize your macOS install media
  - Installer customization: Kernelcache/prelinkedknerel and boot files replacement (a feature that can be handy while dealing with old Macs or with beta installers when you need to mod or change the boot files some times)
 
 Features that I'd like to add in the future:
  - Install clover and configure clover
  - Install kexts inside the kexts folder of clover
  - Clover drivers customization
  - Use custom dsdt in clover
  - integrated pre-made clover config templates database from a remote and open repository
  - Support for other languages, at least Italian

# Rquirements:
 - A computer that runs Mac OS X Yosemite or a more recent version (Mac OS X El Capitan is required to use TINU in a macOS recovery or installer)
 - A drive or a free partition of at least 7 GB
 - A copy of a macOS/Mac OS X installer app (You can use any installer starting from Mavericks up to all the latest versions, any installer that contains "createinstallmedia" is supported)in the /Applications folder or in the root of any storage drive in the system (excepted the drive or volume you want to turn into your macOS install media)
