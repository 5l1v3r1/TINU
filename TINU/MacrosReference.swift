This file contains explaination for the macros used in this app for the compiler to enable some implemented features
To enable each macro you need to go into the build settings section of the project and then add the macros to the Active Compilation Conditions for debug, release or both

- demo
	This is an example macro to let you test macros effects, by enableing this you will see a message of success at the app startup

- debug
	This is normally used to use the LocalAuthentication APIs for the first set user authentication in the app on macOS versions starting from El Capitan (older ones will still use older SecurityFoundation APIs to manage the first step auth)

- usedate
	This will add a string prefix with the date and the precise time in seconds in which that log message was send to the log system, usefoul for debug reasons, WARNING, this may slow down the app while creating the usb instller or while installing macOS

- noFirstAuth
	This will disable first step authentication
